### <u>Faking Damien Hirst.</u>

Using [**colorgram**](https://github.com/obskyr/colorgram.py#colorgrampy) 
and [**Turtle Graphics**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) modules,
this program will create a spot painting Damien Hirst's style.

### <u>Turtle Crossing Game.</u>

You now are a turtle crossing a very bussy street where you only can go forward using your "Up" key of your keyboard.
Each time you reach the other side of the road, the cars will drive faster than before.
Avoid being hit by a car and have a nice game! :)

## Project #18
### <u>Mail Merge Project.</u>
Learning paths. We were given a .txt file with a bunch of name, and a model letter on another directory.
The objective of this program is to automate the task of replaceing the model letter with each name
given on the file, and saving it as a new letter ready to be sent -with a new name based on to whom 
the letter will be sent- on a different folder.
